## PROJECT_1

Your first task is to enhance the supplied images using techniques of contrast adjustment, noise reduction, color correction, and so on. There are 6 images supplied (5 regular photos, and one CT). They might not need the same kind of processing. As a result, you should write your processing techniques as modules so that you can try different combinations or parameters for different images. Try to do your best.
